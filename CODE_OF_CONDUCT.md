# Code of Conduct

## Be Nice

This is a small project, and I want it to be welcoming for everyone. Please:

- Be respectful and constructive in discussions
- Be patient with questions and different perspectives  
- Keep conversations professional and on-topic
- Give credit where it's due

If someone is being disruptive or disrespectful, please open an issue or contact me directly.

That's it! Let's build something cool together.
