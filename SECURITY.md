# Security

## Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security issue, please open a GitHub issue or email me directly. I'll do my best to address it promptly.

For serious vulnerabilities, you can use [GitHub's private security reporting](https://github.com/vkuhlmann/trale/security/advisories/new) if you prefer.

## Note

This is a proof assistant library for formal mathematics. While I take security seriously, this project is primarily for educational and research purposes, not production security-critical systems.
